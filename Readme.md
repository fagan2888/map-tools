[`gps-pick.html`](http://mhlinder.com/map-tools/gps-pick.html) logs a
sequence of GPS coordinates in Google Map, and supports exporting the
points as a CSV (with some help from
[other](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/event-simple)
[people's](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation)
[code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6037712/how-to-float-a-div-over-google-maps)).

[`gps-view.html`](http://mhlinder.com/map-tools/gps-view.html)
displays a path based on a CSV containing the header `lat,lng`.

Note that this brazenly expects HTML5 is installed.
