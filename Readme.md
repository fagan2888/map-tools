Some small tools to do simple things with maps.

* [`gps-pick.html`](http://mhlinder.com/map-tools/gps-pick.html) logs a
  sequence of GPS coordinates in Google Map, and supports exporting the
  points as a CSV (with some help from
  [other](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/event-simple)
  [people's](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation)
  [code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6037712/how-to-float-a-div-over-google-maps)).
* [`gps-view.html`](http://mhlinder.com/map-tools/gps-view.html)
  displays a path stored as a CSV. The file is expected to have the
  the header `lat,lng`, as well as data formatted accordingly.

Note that this brazenly expects HTML5 is installed.
